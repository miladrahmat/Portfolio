## Introduction

This project is a Portfolio website to showcase projects and skills. The portfolio serves as a central hub where recruiters and collaborators can learn more about my background and view my work.

For this project I used **TypeScript**, **React** and **Tailwind CSS** and got to learn how to program a frontend website and deploy using [Vercel.](https://vercel.com/)

- Implemented with **TypeScript** for safety and maintainability
- Modern React-based UI styled with **Tailwind CSS**

### Accessibility
The website is designed with accessibility in mind:
